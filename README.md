Introduction
------------

This is test code, don't expect anything. DONT READ COMMENTS - they are
mostly obsolete and who reads comments anyway? Most functionality that
I added over time is of course now broken or partly deleted in favour 
of implementing new stuff.

While I perfectly understand the code at any time, you probably won't
get any of it. Things are changing pretty fast and thus are done just 
that it works.

My aim is to eventually develop a projection/visualisation method for 
4D space that is actually fully interpretable by human visual cognition.
Once I know how that could possibly work, I will write a FPS like game
engine and some maze game based on that engine.

If you want to know more about 4D use the internet.
